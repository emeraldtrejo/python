Classes and Instances
Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class.
Each variable of a specific class is an instance or object.
Objects can have attributes, which store information about the object.
You can make objects do work by calling their methods.
The first parameter of the methods (self) represents the current instance.
Methods are just like functions, but they can only be used through a class.
Special methods
Special methods start and end with __.
Special methods have specific names, like __init__ for the constructor or __str__ for the conversion to string.
Documenting classes, methods and functions
You can add documentation to classes, methods, and functions by using docstrings right after the definition.
